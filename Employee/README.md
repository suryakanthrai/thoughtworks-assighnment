# Getting Started with Create React App

I have created the react app using the below command 
### `npx create-react-app filename`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
when we create the the app using the the above command including node_modules will be present by default 

After creating the App navigate into created file and run the below command 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
